- 👋 Hi, I’m @kevin21j
- 👀 I’m interested in the world of artificial intelligence and data, 
  in artificial intelligence what would be the chatbots or rather the NLP. 
  When it comes to data, I am struck by what the data scientist would be.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the JavaScript programming language, although learning 
  Python is also on my list. And of course I'm also learning about how to 
  manipulate data to visualize it in an attractive way.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have to do with NLP and data.
- 📫 How to reach me through my email kevin.kantule@gmail.com
